<h2>James Williams, 46 years old * Canton, Ohio</h2>
<p></p>
<p1>James Williams was a 46-year-old Black male who was fatally shot through a wooden fence on January 1, 2022. At the time of his death, James was firing an AR into the air from his fenced patio as a way to celebrate the new year. Because of the sound of gunshots, calls were made to authorities. An officer responded to the reports of gunshots being fired in the neighborhood. The officer approached where James was at, did not announce himself, and fatally shot him through a wood fence. James was then transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Body cam footage was released, and it demonstrated James shooting his gun in the air and the officer firing multiple shots through the wooden fence without issuing any warning. </p1>

<p2>Police chief Jack Angelo stated that his officer had confronted James before the officer shot his firearm. According to Jack, the offer fired his gun due to fear for his safety. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation was called in to conduct an investigation. During the investigation, the officer was placed on administrative leave. This sparked an outrage and protests. James` family filed a lawsuit against the city of Canton, the officer who shot James, and first responders. The Stark County grand jury decided not to indict the officer who shot James Williams. Robert Huber was the officer who killed James Williams. </p2>
