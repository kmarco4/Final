<h2>Keshawn Thomas, 27 years old * Albuquerque, New Mexico</h2>
<p></p>
<p1>Keshawn Thomas was a 27-year-old Black male who killed by police while he was in his car at a gas station on August 28, 2022. A woman working at a gas station called 911 because she had concerns over a man who was parked at a gas pump for hours. Keshawn was passed out in his car because he was intoxicated and could not drive back home. Keshawn let police officers know that he had his gun on him. Keshawn did have his gun in his cab and a magazine in his trunk, but he had his concealed carry license. According to a witness, Keshawn was cooperating with police officers when they spoke to him and was following their instructions to exit his vehicle. One officer searched the car while another spoke to him. According to Keshawn`s lawyer, Keshawn was shot and then told to go back into his car and shot once again when he was in his vehicle. </p1>

<p2>According to body cam footage, Keshawn was seen giving his magazine to police and letting them know that there was a gun in his trunk. Keshawn then got into his vehicle and was “observed reaching around the seat and console area” At this point, one officer who was standing near the driver`s door, walks towards the driver`s side and yells “gun” three times before all three officers open fire 16 times. He was then taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. </p2>

<p3>The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico called for the release of body cam footage to really know what happened to Keshawn that night. According to Keshawn`s lawyer, she believd there was racial bias on how police interacted with who possessed a firearm. She states that police just seem to get a sense of danger when a person of color has a firearm legally in their possession versus a white person. Officers Marcos Flores, Dustin Ketchum, and Kenneth Skeens killed Keshawn Thomas.</p3>
