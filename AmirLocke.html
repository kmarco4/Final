<h2>Amir Locke, 22 years old * Minneapolis, Minnesota</h2>
<p></p>
<p1>Amir Locke was a 22-year-old Black male who was fatally shot by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota during a no-knock raid on February 2, 2022. SWAT officers raided an apartment to serve a warrant related to a homicide investigation in St. Paul, Minnesota. In body cam footage, it is shown Amir Locke being woken up by SWAT officers bursting into the apartment and shining a bright light in his face. While Amir is sitting up, police see a gun in his hand. The officer proceeded to fire three bullets. Amir suffered gunshot wounds to his face, chest, and shoulder. Amir did not live in the apartment he was sleeping at, rather it belonged Mekhi Speed`s older brother`s girlfriend who was a suspect in the St. Paul homicide investigation. It is important to note that this incident lasted less than 10 seconds and Amir was not named on the warrant.</p1>

<p2>After the shooting took place, Minneapolis interim police chief Amelia Huffman stated that her officers had announced "police search warrant" before they entered the apartment. However, the body cam footage showed her officers rushing into the apartment while announcing their presence. Amelia Huffman also stated that the gun was aimed at police, however, body cam footage shows that his gun was pointed towards the floor. </p2>

<p3>Mayor Jacob Frey faced heat because he had claimed to have banned no-knock warrants in the city of Minneapolis. When taking a closer look at the policy revision, it was discovered that the use of different language still allowed police to continue using no-knock warrants just with a different name. </p3>

<p4>In April, prosecutors decided not to press charges against the officer who killed Amir Locke in which they suggested there was not enough evidence against the officer. This sparked the city because another Black victim was killed by police, in a state where George Floyd was killed 2 years prior. The attorneys for the Locke family had called for the officer to be fired and charged for Amir Locke`s murder. Mark Hanneman was the officer who killed Amir Locke. </p4>
