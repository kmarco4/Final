<p2>According to his aunt, Markia Jackson, she stated that her nephew never drove towards the officers and that it was the officers were the ones who put themselves in front of his car then fired at her nephew. Markia stated that the police had failed to immediately take Donnell to the hospital after the shooting. "Donnell is still supposed to be here, probably just recuperating. They let him bleed out on that ground, telling him to "just breathe, bro, breathe, bro." How can you say that when he's on the ground scared for his life?‚Äù After the shooting took place, residents of Baltimore protested for the killing of Donnell Rochester. Citizens also protested Mayor Brandon Scott who commended the officers for responding appropriately and doing a good job. All the officers that were involved had been placed on administrative leave while they wait for the internal and criminal investigation. Connor Murray was the officer who killed Donnell Rochester.</p2>
