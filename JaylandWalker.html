<h2>Jayland Walker, 25 years old * Akron, Ohio</h2>
<p></p>
<p1>Jayland Walker was a 25-year-old Black male who was killed after failing to pull over for police on June 27, 2022. A police officer attempted to pull over Jayland due to the car having a broken taillight and a missing license plate bulb. Jayland failed to stop and continued to drive through city streets before going into the city of Akron which ended in a three-minute chase. </p1>
<p></p>
<p2>According to Akron Police Department, gunfire came from Jayland`s vehicle a minute into the chase. Jayland eventually slowed down, and while the car was still moving, Jayland got out from the car through the passenger side, wearing ski mask, and ran towards a parking lot. Police officers tried to stop Jayland with a stungun but was not successful. After ten seconds of police chasing Jayland, eight police officers began to shoot for about seven seconds, shooting almost 90 rounds. According to police, they believed that Jayland was armed and believed that he was turning towards them in a firing position. Police officers handcuffed Jayland while trying to administer first aid. He was eventually pronounced dead on the scene.</p2>
<p></p>
<p3>According to the Summit County Medical Examiner`s office, his death was ruled as a homicide. Medical examiner released his autopsy results and discovered that Jayland was hit with 46 bullets with no drugs or alcohol in his system. Police did not discover a firearm on Jayland, but rather in his car along with a loaded magazine. The eight officers that were involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave and were reinstated four months after the shooting took place. According to Police Chief Steve Mylett, he was forced to do so because of the shortage of officers. </p3>
<p></p>
<p4>The day of the shooting, protesters came together in front of the police department in Arkon. Barricades were installed around the police department and protests continued for more than three days. The residents of Arkon were so upset with the situation, they had cancelled all fourth of July celebrations and the city of Arkon declared a state of emergency as well as a curfew due to property destructions due to protests.  Eight police officers, that have yet to be named, killed Jayland Walker.</p4>
